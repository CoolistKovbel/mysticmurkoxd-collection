Feel like i cant decide, i wish i could just stop and just think but i need to keep working I need money. This is like that goal that i wanted to complete back in highschool.... took a pause... tried to learn web development while in the most horrible toxic relationship ever. Loosing myself and making bad choices and honest not being certain about about my girlfriend... really shoulve turn the other shoulder but something is fucking fishy.


This is going to be a little bit different from my last applications that i tried to create this will be be basic AF. if you want to team up i would appriacte you... hope you can help me not be so stressed out and help me get back to where i was with positivity and love... not fucking homo. sorry buy this relationship really did a number on me.


## Features

You will be able to mint.
You will be able to announce and pottential win money.
You will be able to create a Servers and channel if you are a member with a certain role and or own a NFT.

Most importantly you will be able to have fun but i swear to god you do stupid shit.. im not the one who will be coming after you.


Please support me. I promise to turn this shit around.

as to the people who are secretly watching me or hidden in the shadows or the poeple trying to make me go crazy or go to therapy... or fucked with me and really turn me against everyone... i hope you know you coudlve just talked to me instead of play games and destory my image or even help my girlfriend and her family destroy my image cause im honestly half angry and half depressed. Darkness consuming my light but sure enough it will be back to the balance before you fucked with my life. Hope you guys can help me get the money that i lost over all this stress. Instead of fucking with me. We could be friends or rivals but no. You wanted something else. I got a lot of people i need to gain respect back from money would really help. trust me i havent forgetten you shit fucks.
