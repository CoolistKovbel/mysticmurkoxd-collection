Feel like i cant decide, i wish i could just stop and just think but i need to keep working I need money. This is like that goal that i wanted to complete back in highschool.... took a pause... tried to learn web development while in the most horrible toxic relationship ever. Loosing myself and making bad choices and honest not being certain about about my girlfriend... really shoulve turn the other shoulder but something is fucking fishy.


This is going to be a little bit different from my last applications that i tried to create this will be be basic AF. if you want to team up i would appriacte you... hope you can help me not be so stressed out and help me get back to where i was with positivity and love... not fucking homo. sorry buy this relationship really did a number on me.

Please support me. I promise to turn this shit around.

as to the people who are secretly watching me or hidden in the shadows or the poeple trying to make me go crazy or go to therapy... or fucked with me and really turn me against everyone... i hope you know you coudlve just talked to me instead of play games and destory my image or even help my girlfriend and her family destroy my image cause im honestly half angry and half depressed. Darkness consuming my light but sure enough it will be back to the balance before you fucked with my life. Hope you guys can help me get the money that i lost over all this stress. Instead of fucking with me. We could be friends or rivals but no. You wanted something else.

### im sorry
Things are not what they seem to me, want to change my life like how i wanted it back in 2019 before 2020 struck, but thanks to an awful mother and her tragic common sense and the things she put in heads, lead me off my path and close to a path to working like a father supporting kids when there isnt anything else he could do and work his life away. instead of allowing me to finnse like my family did but no everything is fucked so 420 blast it doing shit last minute like death is chasing me. Really need to get my blog out after my 2nd project is up and running... maybe.. if only it wont create errors.
