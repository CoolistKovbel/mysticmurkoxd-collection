            This collection was something I had thought about a while ago. My
            cat had a tragic accident one day that costed about 400-500 to just
            kill him or what my sister would say, put him down. It wasnt
            something easy the docters could fix and we didnt have enough money
            to genuelly help him. I didnt want to put him down but he was
            already getting old, i didnt think it was best to do, i told him
            that when he comes home he could have all the shrimp he could eat
            but on that very day we litterally just i dont know feel like we
            murdered him.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 text-[12px] md:text-[18px]">
            So i ended up scratching my project that i wanted to do and wanted
            to do something fun that I could always cherish myself. He was such
            an awesome cat, had him ever since I was 7. We fought when we were
            kids but as time passed we learned to love each other. He eventually
            started to listen to me and I would know when he wanted to leave my
            room. He got used to belly rubs he was best friend. My little
            munchkin.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 text-[12px] md:text-[18px]">
            I forgot what the technical terms are but his legs basically got
            paralized and he was move with his front 2 paws instead. It was the
            worse moment of my life because I myself did not want to belive that
            that day would be the last day that i would ever see him.
          </p>

          <p className="leading-7 text-[12px] md:text-[18px]">
            So I wanted to created this project to just have something to
            remember him by at the same time spread some awareness to animal
            hospitals to be able to study and advance their veterinarian skills
            towards pets to be able to fix them just as they would with humans.
            Im not sure if its a long way to go but I am really sick and tired
            of having people die over the silliest things or even having my pets
            die. I understand we are all mammels and have some sort of life
            expectancy but if we are trying to make a change and go to mars we
            need to focus on human health and if possible pet health as well.
            But not turn this into some sort of owaises where the reach get
            treated with better care than the poor because there is some sort of
            emergency.
